- Multi-Agent Introduction & Patterns
    
    ## Why Multi-Agent Systems?
    
    **Single Agent Limitation:**
    
    ```
    User: "Analyze this production incident and give me a fix"
    
    Single Agent:
    - Reads log
    - Analyzes errors
    - Finds root cause
    - Suggests solution
    - Writes report
    
    Result: Generic analysis, shallow investigation
    
    ```
    
    **Multi-Agent Advantage:**
    
    ```
    User: "Analyze this production incident and give me a fix"
    
    Supervisor Agent:
      ↓
    Log Analyzer (Specialist): Deep error analysis
      ↓
    Root Cause Investigator (Specialist): Finds exact cause
      ↓
    Solution Recommender (Specialist): Expert fix suggestions
      ↓
    Supervisor: Compiles comprehensive report
    
    Result: Deep expertise at each step, better solutions
    
    ```
    
    **Why Better?**
    
    - **Specialization** - Each agent is expert in one task
    - **Modularity** - Replace/upgrade individual agents
    - **Scalability** - Add more agents as needed
    - **Quality** - Focused agents = better results
    
    ---
    
    ## When to Use Multi-Agent
    
    ### ✅ Use Multi-Agent When:
    
    1. **Complex Workflow** - Multiple distinct steps
        - Example: Analyze → Investigate → Recommend → Report
    2. **Specialized Tasks** - Each step needs different expertise
        - Example: Log parsing vs Root cause analysis vs Fix recommendations
    3. **Parallel Processing** - Tasks can run simultaneously
        - Example: Check logs, database, and API status at same time
    4. **Human-like Team** - Mimicking team collaboration
        - Example: QA finds bug → Dev investigates → Architect suggests fix
    
    ---
    
    ### ❌ Use Single Agent When:
    
    1. **Simple Task** - One clear action
        - Example: "Generate test cases for this requirement"
    2. **No Clear Stages** - Everything happens in one step
        - Example: "Summarize this document"
    3. **Single Expertise** - One skill needed
        - Example: "Translate this text to Spanish"

    ## Multi-Agent Communication Patterns
    
    ### **Pattern 1: Sequential (Chain)**
    
    ```
    Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Agent D
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    Requirement → TestCase Generator → Test Executor → Report Generator
    
    ```
    
    **When:** Each step depends on previous step
    
    ---
    
    ### **Pattern 2: Supervisor (Most Common)**
    
    ```
             Supervisor
                ↓
        ┌───────┼───────┐
        ↓       ↓       ↓
    Agent A  Agent B  Agent C
        ↓       ↓       ↓
             Supervisor
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
             Supervisor
                ↓
        ┌───────┼────────────┐
        ↓       ↓            ↓
    Log      Root Cause   Solution
    Analyzer Investigator Recommender
        ↓       ↓            ↓
             Supervisor
           (Final Report)
    
    ```
    
    **When:** Need routing logic, task delegation, coordination
    
    **Benefits:**
    
    - Central control and routing
    - Easy to add new agents
    - Clear task delegation
    - **Most used in LangGraph!**
    
    ---
    
    ### **Pattern 3: Parallel (Concurrent)**
    
    ```
               Start
                 ↓
        ┌────────┼────────┐
        ↓        ↓        ↓
    Agent A   Agent B   Agent C
        ↓        ↓        ↓
        └────────┼────────┘
                 ↓
               Merge
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
        Check Production Issue
                 ↓
        ┌────────┼────────┐
        ↓        ↓        ↓
    Check Logs  Check DB  Check API
        ↓        ↓        ↓
        └────────┼────────┘
                 ↓
        Compile All Findings
    
    ```
    
    **When:** Independent tasks can run simultaneously
    
    ---
    
    ### **Pattern 4: Hierarchical (Nested Supervisors)**
    
    ```
        Main Supervisor
             ↓
        ┌────┼────┐
        ↓    ↓    ↓
     Team A Team B Team C
        ↓
    Supervisor A
        ↓
     ┌──┼──┐
     ↓  ↓  ↓
    A1 A2 A3
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
        Incident Manager
             ↓
        ┌────┼─────┐
        ↓    ↓     ↓
    Backend Frontend DB Team
      Team   Team
        ↓
    Backend Lead
        ↓
     ┌──┼───┐
     ↓  ↓   ↓
    Log API Code
    Check Check Review
    
    ```
    
    **When:** Large-scale, multi-team workflows
    
    ---
    
    ## Focus: Supervisor Pattern in LangGraph
    
    **Why Supervisor Pattern?**
    
    1. **Built-in LangGraph support** - Easy to implement
    2. **Most common in production** - Industry standard
    3. **Flexible** - Easy to add/remove agents
    4. **Clear control flow** - One coordinator
    
    **How It Works:**
    
    ```
    User Input
        ↓
    Supervisor receives task
        ↓
    Supervisor decides: "Which agent should handle this?"
        ↓
    Routes to Agent A
        ↓
    Agent A completes subtask → returns to Supervisor
        ↓
    Supervisor decides: "Route to Agent B"
        ↓
    Agent B completes subtask → returns to Supervisor
        ↓
    Supervisor decides: "All done"
        ↓
    Supervisor compiles final result
        ↓
    User receives complete answer
    
    ```
    
    **Supervisor's Job:**
    
    1. **Route** - Decide which agent to call
    2. **Monitor** - Track progress
    3. **Compile** - Combine results
    4. **Decide** - When to finish
    
    ---
    
    ## Real-World Use Cases
    
    ### **Use Case 1: Incident Response** (We'll Build This!)
    
    ```
    User: "Production API is failing"
        ↓
    Supervisor
        ↓
    Log Analyzer: "Found 500 errors, database timeout"
        ↓
    Supervisor → Root Cause Investigator
        ↓
    Root Cause: "Database connection pool exhausted"
        ↓
    Supervisor → Solution Recommender
        ↓
    Solution: "Increase pool size, restart service"
        ↓
    Supervisor: Compiles full incident report
    
    ```
    
    **Why Multi-Agent?**
    
    - Log analysis needs different expertise than root cause
    - Solution recommendation needs context from both
    - Each agent specializes → better results
    
    ---
    
    ### **Use Case 2: QA Automation Workflow**
    
    ```
    User: "Test this new user registration feature"
        ↓
    Supervisor
        ↓
    TestCase Generator: Creates test cases
        ↓
    Supervisor → Test Executor
        ↓
    Test Executor: Runs tests, captures results
        ↓
    Supervisor → Report Generator
        ↓
    Report Generator: Creates detailed test report
        ↓
    Supervisor: Delivers complete QA deliverable
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### **Use Case 3: Research & Analysis**
    
    ```
    User: "Research competitor pricing strategy"
        ↓
    Supervisor
        ↓
    Data Collector: Gathers competitor data
        ↓
    Supervisor → Analyzer
        ↓
    Analyzer: Analyzes pricing patterns
        ↓
    Supervisor → Report Writer
        ↓
    Report Writer: Creates business report
        ↓
    Supervisor: Delivers research insights
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ## Single Agent vs Multi-Agent: Example
    
    ### **Task:** Analyze production incident
    
    **Single Agent Approach:**
    
    ```python
    def single_agent(incident_log):
        # Do everything in one LLM call
        response = llm.chat(f"""
        Analyze this log, find root cause, and suggest solution:
        {incident_log}
        """)
        return response
    
    ```
    
    **Result:**
    
    - Generic analysis
    - Shallow investigation
    - Basic recommendations
    - One-size-fits-all
    
    ---
    
    **Multi-Agent Approach:**
    
    ```python
    def multi_agent(incident_log):
        # Step 1: Specialized log analysis
        log_analysis = log_analyzer_agent(incident_log)
    
        # Step 2: Deep root cause investigation
        root_cause = investigator_agent(log_analysis)
    
        # Step 3: Expert solution recommendation
        solution = solution_agent(root_cause)
    
        # Supervisor compiles
        return supervisor.compile(log_analysis, root_cause, solution)
    
    ```
    
    **Result:**
    
    - Deep log analysis (specialist)
    - Thorough root cause (specialist)
    - Expert solutions (specialist)
    - Comprehensive report
    
    **Quality difference:** 3x better! 🎯
    
    ---
    
    ## Multi-Agent Benefits
    
    ### **1. Specialization**
    
    ```
    Single Agent: Jack of all trades, master of none
    Multi-Agent: Each agent is expert in one domain
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    - Log Analyzer: Expert in error patterns
    - Root Cause: Expert in system architecture
    - Solution: Expert in fixes and best practices
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. Modularity**
    
    ```
    Single Agent: Change logic = rewrite entire agent
    Multi-Agent: Upgrade one agent, others unaffected
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    Need better log analysis?
    → Replace only Log Analyzer agent
    → Other agents keep working
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. Scalability**
    
    ```
    Single Agent: More tasks = more complex
    Multi-Agent: More tasks = add more agents
    
    ```
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    Add security check?
    → Add Security Agent
    → Supervisor routes to it
    → No code changes to existing agents
    
    ```
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. Maintainability**
    
    ```
    Single Agent: One massive prompt, hard to debug
    Multi-Agent: Small focused prompts, easy to fix
    
    ```
    
    ---

    ```
    Supervisor
        ↓
    Agent A (completes) → Back to Supervisor
        ↓
    Agent B (completes) → Back to Supervisor
        ↓
    Agent C (completes) → Back to Supervisor
        ↓
    Supervisor (finish)
    
    ```
